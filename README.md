# AI & ML Roadmap – 2 Month Intensive

This repository documents my self-designed AI/ML roadmap, focusing on:
- Math foundations & theory behind ML
- Scratch implementations of algorithms
- Complex, fresh real-world projects (not toy datasets)

---

## Roadmap (2 Months – 3 Hrs/Day)
- **Week 01–02**: Math Foundations + Linear/Logistic Regression + PCA  
- **Week 03–04**: Core ML Algorithms (SVM, Decision Trees, Clustering, Dim. Reduction)  
- **Week 05–06**: Advanced ML + Ensembles + Time Series  
- **Week 07–08**: Deep Learning (NNs, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)  

---

## Projects
- House Price Prediction (Linear Regression scratch)
- Eigenfaces with PCA
- Fraud Detection with Imbalanced Data
- Customer Segmentation (GMM + PCA)
- Energy Consumption Forecasting
- Sports Analytics: Match Outcome Prediction
- Neural Network from Scratch (MNIST)
- Image Classification (CNN – CIFAR10)
- Text Sentiment Analysis (LSTM – IMDB Reviews)
- Capstone: AI-Powered Customer Churn + Recommender System

---

## Repository Structure


---

##  Tech Stack
- Python, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow & PyTorch
- Plotly for interactive visualizations
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Notes
- Each week has **theory notebooks + scratch implementations + a project**.  
- By the end, you will have **10+ projects + 2 capstones** for your portfolio.  
- Fresh datasets are used (e.g., credit card fraud, energy forecasting, sports analytics).
