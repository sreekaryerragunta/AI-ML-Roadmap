# AI & ML Roadmap – 2 Month Intensive

This repository documents my self-designed AI/ML roadmap, focusing on:
- Math foundations  
- Scratch implementations  
- Complex real-world projects  

## Roadmap
- Week 01–02: Math Foundations + Linear/Logistic Regression + PCA  
- Week 03–04: Core ML Algorithms (SVM, Trees, Clustering)  
- Week 05–06: Advanced ML + Time Series + Ensembles  
- Week 07–08: Deep Learning (NNs, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)  

## Projects
- House Price Prediction (Linear Regression scratch)
- Eigenfaces with PCA
- Fraud Detection with Imbalanced Data
- Customer Segmentation (GMM + PCA)
- Energy Consumption Forecasting
- Neural Network from Scratch (MNIST)
- Image Classification (CNN)
- Text Sentiment Analysis (LSTM)
- Capstone: AI-Powered Churn Prediction + Recommender
